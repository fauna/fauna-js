     *  Type information allows the driver and Fauna to distinguish between types such as int" and "long" which do not
     * have a standard way of distinguishing in JSON.
     * Since Fauna assumes typed information is transmitted by default, clients can leave this value undefined to make
     * full usage of Fauna's primitive types.
     * You can also explicitly set this to "tagged" to get the typing data sent.
     * Rare use cases can also deal with standard JSON by setting the value to "simple". Not that the types
     * enocodable in standard JSON are a subset of the types encodable in the default "tagged" format.
     * It is not recommended that users use the "simple" format as you will lose the typing of your data. e.g. a "Date"
     * will no longer be recognized by the Fauna as a "Date", but will instead be treated as a string.
